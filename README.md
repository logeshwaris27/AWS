# AWS
What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

What is the advantage of using cloud computing?
Trade fixed expense for variable expense – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

Benefit from massive economies of scale – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

Stop guessing capacity – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

Increase speed and agility – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

Go global in minutes – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

What are the types of cloud computing?
1.Public cloud
2.Hybrid
3.Private / On-premises cloud

Global infrastructure of AWS
For high availability and fault tolerance AWS maintains Global infrastructure.
1.Regions
2.Availability zones
3.Edge locations

As of now there are 32 launched regions , 102 availability zones and 600+ points of presence and 13 regional edge caches.

Security and Compliance
The AWS Cloud enables a shared responsibility model. While AWS manages security of the cloud, you are responsible for security in the cloud.
Benefits of AWS security
Keep Your data safe — The AWS infrastructure puts strong safeguards in place to help protect your privacy. All data is stored in highly secure AWS data centers.

Meet compliance requirements — AWS manages dozens of compliance programs in its infrastructure. This means that segments of your compliance have already been completed.

Save money: —Cut costs by using AWS data centers. Maintain the highest standard of security without having to manage your own facility

Scale quickly — Security scales with your AWS Cloud usage. No matter the size of your business, the AWS infrastructure is designed to keep your data safe.

Compliance

AWS Cloud Compliance helps you understand the robust controls in place at AWS for security and data protection in the cloud. Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer, and you can visit the Shared Responsibility Model to learn more. Customers can feel confident in operating and building on top of the security controls AWS uses on its infrastructure.

The IT infrastructure that AWS provides to its customers is designed and managed in alignment with best security practices and a variety of IT security standards. The following is a partial list of assurance programs with which AWS complies:

SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3

FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP

PCI DSS Level 1

ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018

Amazon Web Services Cloud

AWS consists of many cloud services that you can use in combinations tailored to your business or organizational needs. This section introduces the major AWS services by category. To access the services, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or Software Development Kits (SDKs).
